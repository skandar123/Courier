/*
 * Name: Sayantika Kandar
 * Purpose: Service class responsible for creating shipments by grouping packages
 * based on the maximum carriable weight of a vehicle.
 *
 * This class applies a greedy approach:
 *   - Sorts packages by descending weight
 *   - Iteratively assigns them into shipments using ShipmentBuilder
 *   - Ensures no package exceeds the max carriable weight
 *   - Distributes all packages across shipments
