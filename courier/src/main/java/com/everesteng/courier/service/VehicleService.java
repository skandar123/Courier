 * Name: Sayantika Kandar
 * Purpose: Service class responsible for assigning vehicles to shipments
 * and updating their availability times.
 *
 * This class ensures:
 *   - Vehicles are assigned fairly using a priority queue (min-heap).
 *   - The vehicle with the earliest availability is always chosen.
 *   - Package delivery times are adjusted based on vehicle availability.
 *   - Vehicle availability is updated after completing each shipment.
